# DevExtreme with webpack and AngularJS example

This project demonstrates how to use DevExtreme widgets loading only modules with the required functionality. This demo shows the dxButton widget with the alert dialog as an example. Here, the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) approach is used. The example requires installed [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/).
