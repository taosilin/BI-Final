# Universal-Angular

This sample project demonstrates the use of DevExtreme Angular components in an Angular Universal application with server-side rendering.

DevExtreme Angular components [were added to a project](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-angular#adding-devexteme-to-an-existing-angular-application) generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Then, the project was converted to [Angular Universal](https://angular.io/guide/universal).
