# DevExtreme with RequireJS and AngularJS example

This project demonstrates how to use DevExtreme widgets loading only modules with the required functionality. This demo shows the dxButton widget with the alert dialog as an example. Here, the [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) approach is used. The example uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) to load scripts on demand.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
 ``` text
 git clone https://github.com/devexpress/devextreme-examples.git
 ```

2. Go to the project folder
 ``` text
 cd devextreme-examples/requirejs-angularjs
 ```

3. Install the required modules. This command will also convert the DevExtreme package to the AMD module format by using the npm postinstall script.
 ``` text
 npm install
 ```

4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
